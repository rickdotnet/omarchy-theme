This theme is forked from [Rnedlose/omarchy-vague-theme](https://github.com/Rnedlose/omarchy-vague-theme). It's a sweet theme and you should go check out his repo.

This fork exists due to Omarchy auto-updating themes installed via Git. I don't love the idea of a back door into my system being a commit away. :D
